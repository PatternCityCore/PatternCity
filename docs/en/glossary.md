# Glossary – PatternCity

This glossary defines key terms of the cognitive architecture known as “PatternCity.”  
The terms are not metaphors in a literary sense but functional model components within an internal cognitive system.

## Terms

### **Thinking City (Denkstadt)**
A structured spatial model of one’s own thinking.  
It consists of districts, buildings, streets, and light signals.  
The Thinking City serves as an internal functional representation of cognitive processes.

---

### **Tower (Turm)**
A vertical central structure within the Thinking City, composed of multiple functional levels.  
It houses the Cutter. The Tower represents control, structure, and prioritization.  
It is not a symbol of power or personality but serves as a core infrastructure element.

---

### **Cutter**
An internal instance (or agent) responsible for retrospective processing.  
The Cutter stores social scenes, analyzes and compares them, but does not evaluate them emotionally.  
It sorts according to functional criteria (e.g., relevance, deviation, repetition).  
It sits in the control center above the Archive and selectively displays excerpts for reflection.

---

### **Archive**
A functional unit located beneath the Cutter in the Tower.  
It serves as storage for scenes marked by the Cutter.

---

### **Instance / Agent**
Both terms are used interchangeably.  
They refer to functional units within the Thinking City, each with specific tasks, access zones, and interactions.  
Important: They do not act autonomously like “characters,” but systemically—as structural elements of a functional architecture.
