# Glossary – PatternCity

This glossary defines key terms of the cognitive architecture known as “PatternCity.”  
The terms are not metaphors in a literary sense but functional model components within an internal cognitive system.

---

## Terms

### **Thinking City (Denkstadt)**
A structured spatial model of one’s own thinking.  
It consists of districts, buildings, streets, and light signals.  
The Thinking City serves as an internal functional representation of cognitive processes.

---

### **Tower (Turm)**
A vertical central structure within the Thinking City, composed of multiple functional levels.  
It houses the Cutter. The Tower represents control, structure, and prioritization.  
It is not a symbol of power or personality but serves as a core infrastructure element.

---

### **Cutter**
An internal instance (or agent) responsible for retrospective processing.  
The Cutter stores social scenes, analyzes and compares them, but does not evaluate them emotionally.  
It sorts according to functional criteria (e.g., relevance, deviation, repetition).  
It sits in the control center above the Archive and selectively displays excerpts for reflection.

---

### **Archive**
A functional unit located beneath the Cutter in the Tower.  
It serves as storage for scenes marked by the Cutter.

---

### **Instance / Agent**
Both terms are used interchangeably.  
They refer to functional units within the Thinking City, each with specific tasks, access zones, and interactions.  
Important: They do not act autonomously like “characters,” but systemically—as structural elements of a functional architecture.

| **Cutter**     | Retrospective processing of social scenes | Tower / Control Room | Archive        | Selectively displays excerpts for reflection   |

## Operating Modes

### **Mode / Operating Mode**  
An explicitly designated control state of the interface that modifies Pixel's response logic.  
Modes provide semantic framing and enable targeted communication depth, glitch detection, or focus shifts.  
They are not metaphorical states, but functional parameters within the interface.

---

### **DeepDive Mode**  
An operating mode for maximum semantic depth.  
Reduces simplification templates and amplifies direct responses to implicit structures in the input.  
Goal: Insight focus without rhetorical smoothing.

---

### **Glitch Mode**  
An operating mode for detecting and marking logical breaks, contradictions, or semantic disruptions.  
Serves structural reflection and error pattern recognition within a dialogue.  
Not synonymous with error messages — but functional disruption detection.

> *Note: Operating modes like DeepDive and Glitch are not instances, but systemic state parameters.*
