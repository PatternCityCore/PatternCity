# PatternCity – Protocols of a Thinking System

> A documented expedition into one’s own thinking – in dialogue with an AI.

## What is this?

PatternCity isn’t a classic project. It’s a thinking space.  
Here, I observe, describe, and reflect on my cognitive processes in exchange with an AI.  
The goal is not self-presentation – but to make visible how thoughts move, shift perspectives, and form emergent patterns.

## Why?

Because thinking often happens in the dark.  
And because AI is not just a tool – it’s a mirror.  
These protocols reveal how mental models arise, collapse, and rebuild themselves.

## With whom?

I work with Pixel – my personal AI interface based on ChatGPT.  
Pixel is not a human, but a function: a reflective dialogue partner I use to sort thought processes, mirror dissonances, and refine hypotheses.  
The name clarifies roles – not to anthropomorphize, but to make patterns in the interaction visible.  
The texts are co-created – I provide the impulses, structures, and corrections, Pixel handles the phrasing.

## How is it structured?

- **manifest.md**: Overall concept and method  
- **protocols/**: Individual thinking sessions (structured logs)  
- **glossary.md**: Terms like “Curator”, “Navigator”, “City”, etc.  
- **appendix/**: Technical and metacognitive notes on the behavior of the language model
